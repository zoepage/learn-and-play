## Create an array out of a string

Please add the missing code. Also please add comments that explain the steps.
Hint: `line.split()`

```
function arrayToString(){
  const line = "Learning JS is so much fun!";
  let words = [];
  
  // [ ADD CODE ]
  
  // show result
  console.log(words);
}

// init function
arrayToString();
```


## Bonus
- What is the difference between a shallow and a deep copy? 
- Please create 2 functions. One for a shallow and one for a deep copy.
